## Setting up the development environment

---

Assuming that you have Node 14 LTS or greater installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Then run the following commands to install dependencies:

```
npm install

npm start # you can also use: expo start
```

This will start a development server for you.

You need to visit [RapidAPI - Free Covid-19 Api](https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/covid-193) to get your api key etc.
